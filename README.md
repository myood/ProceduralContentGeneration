# Procedural Content Generation
Sample code repository for 'Procedural Content Generation for C++ Game Development' ported to Linux
Requirements for debian-based distros: there is configured sudo, git, compiler and cmake 
If requirements are met, then the build should work out of the box (script build.sh will call apt install libsfml-dev)
